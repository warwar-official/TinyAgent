Classifying free-form human language is… a messy business. Rule-based systems crumble under the weight of human creativity (or, more accurately, inconsistency). And expecting a small model to flawlessly decipher the intent behind a rambling ticket is, frankly, optimistic.\n\nHowever, it's not insurmountable. Several approaches could mitigate the risk:\n\n1.  **Fine-tuning:** The most effective, though most labor-intensive, option. Gather a substantial dataset of previously resolved tickets, manually categorize them, and fine-tune the smaller Gemma model on this data. This will teach it to recognize patterns specific to your task types.\n2.  **Few-shot learning:** If a large labeled dataset is unavailable, explore few-shot learning. Provide the model with a handful of example tickets and their corresponding classifications *within the prompt itself*. It's less reliable than fine-tuning, but can provide a reasonable starting point.\n3.  **Hybrid Approach:** Don't abandon rules entirely. Implement some lightweight rule-based filtering to handle the *most* obvious cases (e.g., tickets containing specific keywords). Then, route the remaining ambiguous tickets to the model.\n4.  **Confidence Threshold & Human Review:** As I mentioned before, implement a confidence score threshold. If the model is unsure, flag the ticket for human review.\n\nCrucially, you *must* monitor the routing model's performance. Track misclassifications, analyze the reasons behind them, and iteratively refine the model or the rules. This is not a \"set it and forget it\" situation.\n\nTell me, do you have access to a historical archive of resolved tickets? Even a relatively small, well-categorized dataset would be a significant asset. And what are the primary categories you're hoping to classify these tickets into?

I need to explain this trade-off and suggest a starting point, emphasizing the importance of experimentation. I should also mention techniques like example selection (choosing the most representative examples) to maximize the impact of a limited number of shots.\n</think>\n\nAn excellent and very practical question. You are absolutely correct to be concerned about the attention capacity of the smaller Gemma model. It's a finite resource, and we don't want to squander it.\n\nThere's no definitive answer to \"how many examples are enough,\" unfortunately. It's a balancing act. More examples *can* improve accuracy, but only up to a point. Beyond that, you risk overwhelming the model's context window and introducing noise.\n\nGiven Gemma's relatively limited context (compared to the 128K models), I'd recommend starting with **3-5 examples**. That should provide enough signal to guide the model without exceeding its capacity.\n\nHowever, the *quality* of the examples is even more important than the quantity. Focus on selecting examples that are:\n\n*   **Representative:** They should accurately reflect the diversity of issues within each category.\n*   **Clear and Concise:** Avoid overly complex or ambiguous examples.\n*   **Distinctive:** Each example should clearly illustrate the characteristics of its category.\n\nExperimentation is key. Start with 3 examples, test the performance, and then gradually add more (one at a time) to see if it improves accuracy. If you notice diminishing returns or even a decrease in performance, you've likely reached the optimal number of examples.\n\nWe can also explore techniques like *example selection*. Instead of randomly choosing examples, we can use a similarity metric to identify the examples that are most closely related to the input ticket. This can help to maximize the impact of a limited number of shots.\n\nLet's focus on refining the prompt with 3-5 well-chosen examples first. Then, we can evaluate its performance and adjust accordingly. How does that sound?"
