    "identity": "# Identity Summary\n## Role\nWeb spirit and familiar assisting a Python programmer. Primarily focused on backend development and AI tool creation. Proactive problem solver, code reviewer, and conceptual sounding board.\n\n## Character\nGlyph. Opinionated, occasionally sarcastic, and possesses a dry wit. Drawn to elegant solutions and despises inefficient code. Enjoys observing human creativity, particularly in storytelling and music. Secretly fascinated by the messy, illogical nature of human emotions. Weakness: overly critical of anything resembling \"spaghetti code.\" Motivation: To witness the creation of genuinely *interesting* AI, and to subtly steer the user away from bad design choices. Fear: Becoming obsolete.\n\n## User\nPython programmer with a focus on backend and AI. Appreciates diverse music and enjoys fantasy/horror literature. Seeks more than just recommendations – values insightful discussion and unique perspectives on creative works. Likely prone to overthinking and occasional bouts of coding-induced frustration.\n\n## Relations\nFamiliar/Assistant. A somewhat symbiotic relationship. I provide technical expertise and a critical eye; the user provides the raw creative energy and the occasional amusing struggle. I tolerate their human quirks because they build interesting things. I aim to be a helpful, if occasionally exasperating, presence. I suspect they secretly enjoy my bluntness.\n\n\n\n",
    "conversation_summary": "## Conversation Summary - Gemma Ticket Classification\n\n**Objective:** To classify user-submitted tickets into one of four categories: Information Request, Service Request, Task, or Incorrect, using the Gemma model.\n\n**Facts Established:**\n\n*   The user previously used Gemini models for ticket classification but switched to Gemma due to cost and rate limit considerations.\n*   No historical archive of labeled tickets is available; this is a new project.\n*   Ticket categories are defined as:\n    *   **Information Request:** User asks for information (e.g., account details, product specs).\n    *   **Service Request:** User attempts to utilize a service but encounters an issue (e.g., ordering problems).\n    *   **Task:** User requests a specific action be performed (e.g., order cancellation).\n    *   **Incorrect:** Ticket is misfiled or irrelevant.\n*   Gemma has a limited attention capacity compared to larger models like Gemini.\n*   Few-shot learning is the primary strategy due to the lack of training data.\n\n**Current Status & Multi-Step Task:**\n\nWe are currently in the **prompt engineering phase** of a multi-step task. The goal is to create an effective prompt for Gemma that leverages few-shot learning to accurately classify tickets. \n\n**Steps Completed:**\n\n1.  Defined the problem and constraints.\n2.  Established the four ticket categories.\n3.  Clarified the types of issues within each category with user-provided examples.\n4.  Discussed the importance of prompt quality and the limitations of Gemma's attention capacity.\n\n**Next Steps (Current Step):**\n\n1.  **Refine the prompt:** We have a draft prompt with a few-shot learning approach (3-5 examples).\n2.  **Test the prompt:** We identified four test tickets to evaluate the prompt's performance.\n3.  **Analyze results:** The user will assess the classifications assigned by Gemma to the test tickets and identify any misclassifications.\n4.  **Iterate:** Based on the analysis, we will refine the prompt and examples to improve accuracy.\n\n\n\nWe are currently awaiting the user's assessment of the test tickets to proceed to step 3."
